# CollegeConnect Information System

## Theme: ISMT College

Welcome to the CollegeConnect Information System. This system is designed to enhance communication and transparency between the college and parents by providing a comprehensive platform for monitoring student performance, attendance, and financial status.

## Problem Statement

At ISMT College, keeping parents informed about their children's academic performance, attendance, and financial obligations can be challenging. Traditional methods of communication, such as sending SMS or emails, often lead to delays and information gaps.
